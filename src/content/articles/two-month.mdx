# Two Months In: Pushing Past Limits – It’s All Mental

It’s been two months since I made that first promise to myself. I remember the feeling, the weight of that decision to train every single day, no matter what. And now, after 60 days of relentless work, I’m still here, still standing, still pushing harder than ever. What I’ve realized over these last few weeks, though, is that the limits I thought I had? They were mostly in my head.

For the first month, it was tough—brutally tough. I followed my seven-day split: push, pull, legs, shoulders/traps/forearms, and repeated. No breaks. No rest. I trained every day till I physically couldn’t lift anymore. The fatigue was real, my body was sore, and for a while, it felt like I was just barely hanging on. But I kept going. And now, after two months of grinding it out, something clicked.

I don’t need rest. Not the way I thought I did. This whole time, I was convincing myself that eventually, I’d hit a wall. That I’d need to slow down, recover, and take a breather. But I don’t. Not today. Not tomorrow.

Because this journey? It’s not just physical—it’s mental. It’s about locking in, focusing on what’s in front of me, and realizing that I can push myself way further than I ever thought possible. If you boil it down to a simple choice, it’s either yes or no: Will you train today? Will you give it everything you’ve got? For me, the answer is always yes.

I’ve been training like a madman, and now my body is finally catching up. I no longer feel crushed by the weight of the fatigue. I feel strong. I feel ready. Every single workout is still to failure, but the difference now is that I know I can do it again tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that. I’ve learned that the limitations I used to believe in aren’t real. They’re just my mind telling me to stop, and I’ve learned how to ignore that voice.

I’ve read countless articles, watched hours of videos, and yes, I’m learning what works for me physically. My diet is locked in: 3,400 calories a day, 180 grams of protein, and I’ve gained weight—up to 149 pounds. The physical progress is there. I see it in the mirror, and I feel it in the gym.

But more than that, I’m discovering that I’m capable of more than I ever gave myself credit for. When it comes down to it, you can always go further. You just have to commit. Every day is a mental battle—a decision to step into the gym and give it everything, to push past what your body thinks is failure, because that’s when real growth happens.

Today’s lift will be just like all the others: I’ll train till absolute muscular failure, and I’ll give it everything. But the truth is, I know I can push harder. I don’t need rest. I can go again tomorrow and the next day. I’ve found this place inside myself where the excuses don’t matter, where the fatigue doesn’t scare me anymore. It’s a switch I’ve flipped, and I’m not turning it off.

The only thing that matters is whether I show up and put in the work. And I will, every single day. Because this is a mental game, and I’m winning it.
